# FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Common Questions and Solutions**

## General Questions

### What is Cloudeval?

Cloudeval is an AI-powered cloud infrastructure visualization platform that automatically generates architecture diagrams from your Infrastructure as Code (ARM templates and Bicep files), answers questions about your infrastructure, and helps optimize costs.

### How does Cloudeval work?

Cloudeval works with your Infrastructure as Code files:

1. Upload your ARM template or Bicep file
2. Cloudeval parses and analyzes the code
3. Maps resources and dependencies
4. Generates interactive diagrams
5. You can ask questions, edit code, and export diagrams

### Is Cloudeval secure?

Yes. Cloudeval:

- **No Cloud Access Required** - Works entirely from your code files
- **Encrypted Storage** - All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **SOC 2 Compliant** - Enterprise-grade security standards
- **GDPR Compliant** - Full data privacy compliance
- **No Data Sharing** - Your infrastructure code is never shared

### What Infrastructure as Code formats are supported?

**Available Now:**

- Azure ARM Templates (JSON)
- Modular templates (linked templates)

- Medium template (20-100 resources): 10-30 seconds
- Large template (100-500 resources): 30-60 seconds
- Very large template (> 500 resources): 1-2 minutes

### Why is my diagram empty?

**Possible causes:**

- Template has no resource definitions
- Template structure is incorrect
- Resources are in wrong section
- Syntax errors preventing parsing

**Solutions:**

- Verify template structure
- Check for syntax errors
- Ensure resources are in `resources` section
- Try validating with Azure CLI first

### Can I customize the diagram layout?

Yes. You can:

- Reposition nodes manually
- Choose layout algorithms
- Group resources
- Apply color schemes
- Add annotations

### How do I export diagrams?

Click **Export** and choose format:

- PNG (images)
- SVG (vector)
- Visio (VSDX)
- draw.io (XML)
- PDF (documents)

## AI Chat

### How does the AI chat work?

The AI analyzes your Infrastructure as Code and answers questions in natural language. It understands your resources, relationships, and can provide insights.

### What can I ask the AI?

You can ask about:

- Resources and their properties
- Parameters and variables
- Dependencies and relationships
- Security issues
- Cost optimization
- Architecture explanations

### Is the AI accurate?

The AI uses your actual Infrastructure as Code, so it's highly accurate. However, it's a tool to assist you - always verify critical information.

### Can the AI modify my infrastructure?

No. The AI can only read and analyze. It cannot make changes to your code or infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

### Template Parsing Issues

#### Template parsing fails

**Problem:** Can't parse ARM template or Bicep file

**Symptoms:**

- Error message when uploading
- Empty diagram after upload
- Parsing errors in console

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify file format:**

   - ARM templates must be valid JSON
   - Bicep files must be valid Bicep syntax
   - Check file encoding (UTF-8)

2. **Check for syntax errors:**

   - Validate JSON syntax (use JSON validator)
   - Validate Bicep syntax (use `az bicep build`)
   - Look for missing commas, brackets, quotes

3. **Validate with Azure CLI:**

   ```bash
   # For ARM templates
   az deployment group validate \
     --resource-group my-rg \
     --template-file template.json \
     --parameters @parameters.json

   # For Bicep files
   az bicep build --file main.bicep
   ```

4. **Check required parameters:**

   - Ensure all required parameters are provided
   - Verify parameter types match
   - Check for missing parameter files

5. **Modular templates:**
   - Upload all linked templates
   - Verify template references are correct
   - Check for circular dependencies

#### Partial parsing (some resources missing)

**Problem:** Only some resources appear in diagram

**Solutions:**

- Check if resources are in correct section (`resources` array)
- Verify resource definitions are complete
- Check for conditional resources (may be filtered)
- Ensure all linked templates are uploaded

#### Linked template errors

**Problem:** Linked templates not resolving

**Solutions:**

- Upload all linked template files
- Verify template reference URLs/paths
- Check template schema versions
- Ensure templates are accessible

### Diagram Issues

#### Diagram doesn't update after editing

**Problem:** Changes in editor don't reflect in diagram

**Solutions:**

1. **Save changes:**

   - Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac) to save
   - Enable auto-save in settings
   - Wait for save confirmation

2. **Refresh diagram:**

   - Click "Refresh Diagram" button
   - Close and reopen diagram view
   - Reload the page

3. **Check for errors:**

   - Look for syntax errors in editor
   - Verify template is valid
   - Check error panel for issues

4. **Verify changes:**
   - Ensure changes are actually saved
   - Check if changes are in correct file
   - Verify file is the one being displayed

#### Empty or incomplete diagram

**Problem:** Diagram shows no resources or missing resources

**Solutions:**

- Verify template has resources defined
- Check if resources are in `resources` section
- Ensure template parsed successfully
- Check filters aren't hiding resources
- Verify all linked templates uploaded

#### Diagram is too cluttered

**Problem:** Too many resources, hard to read

**Solutions:**

- Use filters to focus on specific resources
- Group related resources
- Use different views (network, security, cost)

- Adjust zoom level

#### Resources not connecting

**Problem:** Dependencies not showing connections

**Solutions:**

- Verify `dependsOn` properties are correct
- Check resource references are valid
- Ensure related resources are in template
- Check for circular dependencies

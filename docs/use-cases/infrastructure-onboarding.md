2. **Create walkthrough** - Guide new users through infrastructure
3. **Add context** - Explain business logic and decisions
4. **Document patterns** - Show common architecture patterns

### Step 3: Share with New Team Members

1. **Export diagrams** - PNG, PDF, or shareable links
2. **Create documentation** - Combine diagrams with explanations
3. **Share access** - Give team members access to Cloudeval project
4. **Schedule walkthrough** - Live session to explain architecture

### Step 4: Enable Self-Service Learning

1. **Enable AI Chat** - Let new members ask questions
2. **Provide examples** - Show common queries
3. **Document workflows** - How infrastructure is used
4. **Create FAQ** - Common questions and answers

## Key Features for Onboarding

### Visual Diagrams

**Benefits:**
- **Quick Understanding** - See entire infrastructure at a glance
- **Relationships** - Understand how components connect
- **Dependencies** - See what depends on what
- **Grouping** - Resources organized logically

**Use Cases:**
- High-level architecture overview
- Detailed component deep-dives
- Network topology visualization
- Resource group organization

### Interactive Exploration

**AI Chat Features:**
- **Ask Questions** - "What does this resource do?"
- **Explore Relationships** - "What depends on this storage account?"
- **Understand Purpose** - "Why is this configured this way?"
- **Learn Patterns** - "Show me all load balancers"

**Example Questions:**
```
"What resources are in the production environment?"
"Show me all databases and their connections"
"What is the purpose of this virtual network?"
"Which resources handle user authentication?"
```

### Custom Annotations

**Add Context:**
- **Labels** - Name important components
- **Notes** - Explain design decisions
- **Highlights** - Mark critical resources
- **Groupings** - Organize by function

**Example:**
- Label: "User Authentication Service"
- Note: "Handles all user login requests"
- Highlight: Critical production resources
- Group: "Frontend Services", "Backend Services", "Data Layer"

### Export for Documentation

**Formats:**
- **PNG** - For presentations and documents
- **PDF** - For comprehensive documentation
- **SVG** - For scalable graphics
- **Shareable Links** - For interactive access

**Use Cases:**
- Onboarding documentation
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks and playbooks
- Stakeholder presentations

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

- **High-Level First** - Start with overview, then details
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Add complexity gradually
- **Focus Areas** - Start with relevant areas
- **Build Context** - Explain why before what

### Make It Interactive

- **Encourage Questions** - Use AI chat actively
- **Explore Together** - Live walkthrough sessions
- **Self-Service** - Let them explore independently
- **Practice** - Hands-on exploration

### Keep It Updated

- **Regular Updates** - Update diagrams when infrastructure changes
- **Version Control** - Track changes over time
- **Document Changes** - Explain what changed and why
- **Archive Old Versions** - Keep history for reference

### Combine with Other Resources

- **Code Comments** - Link to code documentation
- **Runbooks** - Connect to operational procedures
- **ADRs** - Link to architecture decision records
- **Training Materials** - Combine with training docs

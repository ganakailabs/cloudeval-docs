## Before and After

### From Code to Diagram

See how Infrastructure as Code translates to visual diagrams.

**Before: ARM Template**
```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
      "name": "my-web-app",
      "properties": {
        "serverFarmId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', 'my-app-plan')]"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
      "name": "my-app-plan"
    }
  ]
}
```

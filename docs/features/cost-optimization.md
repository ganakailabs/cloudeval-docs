# Cost Optimization

!!! warning "Coming Soon"
    Advanced cost optimization with detailed analysis and AI-powered recommendations is coming in **Mid February 2026** as part of our "Deeper AI Understanding & Cloud Insight" release.

    Currently, Cloudeval provides **interactive visualizations with cost overlays** as part of the core platform. For advanced cost optimization features, [view our roadmap](https://cloudeval.ai/home/roadmap).

    **[Join our waitlist](https://cloudeval.ai/waitlist)** to be notified when this feature launches.

**AI-Powered Recommendations to Reduce Cloud Spending**

Cloudeval will analyze your Infrastructure as Code to identify cost optimization opportunities, estimate spending, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce your cloud costs.

## Overview

Cost Optimization helps you:

- **Estimate Costs** - Get cost estimates for your infrastructure
- **Identify Savings** - Find opportunities to reduce spending
- **Right-Size Resources** - Recommendations for optimal resource sizing
- **Reserved Instances** - Suggestions for reserved capacity
- **Waste Detection** - Identify unused or over-provisioned resources
- **Cost Tracking** - Monitor costs over time

## How It Works

### Cost Analysis

When you upload or analyze your Infrastructure as Code:

1. **Resource Inventory** - Identifies all billable resources
2. **Cost Estimation** - Calculates estimated monthly/annual costs
3. **Optimization Analysis** - Finds cost-saving opportunities
4. **Recommendations** - Provides specific optimization suggestions
5. **Savings Potential** - Estimates potential cost reductions

### Cost Estimation

Cloudeval estimates costs based on:

- **Resource Types** - VM sizes, storage types, database tiers
- **Azure Pricing** - Current Azure pricing data
- **Usage Patterns** - Estimated usage based on configuration
- **Regional Pricing** - Location-specific costs

## Cost Optimization Features

### Resource Sizing Recommendations

Identifies opportunities to right-size resources:

**Checks for:**

- Over-provisioned VMs (too large for workload)
- Under-utilized storage (premium when standard would work)
- Oversized databases (higher tier than needed)
- Unnecessary premium features

**Example Recommendation:**

```
Cost Optimization: VM 'vm-web-server' is over-provisioned
   Current: Standard_D4s_v3 (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM) - $292/month
   Recommended: Standard_D2s_v3 (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) - $146/month
   Potential Savings: $146/month (50% reduction)
   Risk: Low - Monitor CPU/memory usage to confirm
```

### Reserved Instance Suggestions

Recommends reserved capacity for predictable workloads:

**Identifies:**

- Long-running VMs suitable for reservations
- Databases that qualify for reserved capacity
- Storage that could use reserved pricing
- Potential savings with 1-year or 3-year commitments

**Example Recommendation:**

```
Cost Optimization: Consider Reserved Instances for 'vm-database'
   Current: Pay-as-you-go - $350/month
   With 1-year RI: $245/month (30% savings)
   With 3-year RI: $175/month (50% savings)
   Estimated Annual Savings: $1,260 - $2,100
```

### Storage Optimization

Finds storage cost optimization opportunities:

**Checks for:**

- Premium storage where standard would suffice
- Unused storage accounts
- Inefficient storage tiers
- Missing lifecycle management

**Example Recommendation:**

```
Cost Optimization: Storage account 'stg-archive' uses premium tier
   Current: Premium LRS - $0.15/GB/month
   Recommended: Cool Blob Storage - $0.01/GB/month
   Potential Savings: 93% reduction for infrequently accessed data
```

### Database Optimization

Identifies database cost savings:

**Checks for:**

- Over-provisioned database tiers
- Unused databases
- Missing auto-pause for dev/test
- Inefficient service tiers

**Example Recommendation:**

```
Cost Optimization: SQL Database 'db-dev' runs 24/7
   Current: S2 tier - $75/month (always on)
   Recommended: Basic tier with auto-pause - $5/month
   Potential Savings: $70/month (93% reduction for dev environment)
```

### Network Cost Optimization

Finds network-related cost savings:

**Checks for:**

- Unused public IPs
- Inefficient traffic routing
- Missing CDN for static content
- Over-provisioned bandwidth

## Using Cost Optimization

### View Cost Estimates

1. **Upload or open** your Infrastructure as Code
2. **Cost panel** appears automatically
3. **Review estimates** for all resources
4. **See breakdown** by resource type and region

### Review Recommendations

1. **Open Cost Optimization** panel
2. **Browse recommendations** organized by:
   - Potential savings (highest first)
   - Resource type
   - Risk level
3. **Click recommendation** to see details
4. **View impact** - Estimated savings and risks

### Apply Optimizations

1. **Select a recommendation**
2. **Review details** and potential impact
3. **Edit code** in the web editor
4. **Re-analyze** to see updated cost estimate

### Export Cost Report

Generate cost reports:

1. Click **Export** → **Cost Report**
2. Choose format (PDF, Excel, JSON)
3. Include:
   - Current cost estimates
   - Optimization recommendations
   - Potential savings summary
   - Resource cost breakdown

## Cost Analysis Views

- **Risk Assessment** - Impact of each optimization
- **Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step changes
- **ROI Calculation** - Return on investment

## Best Practices

### Regular Cost Reviews

- **Monthly Reviews** - Review costs and optimizations monthly
- **After Changes** - Re-analyze after infrastructure changes
- **Before Scaling** - Check costs before scaling up
- **Budget Planning** - Use estimates for budget planning

### Prioritize High-Impact Changes

Focus on:

1. **High Savings, Low Risk** - Easy wins (e.g., dev/test optimizations)
2. **High Savings, Medium Risk** - Plan carefully (e.g., right-sizing production)
3. **Medium Savings, Low Risk** - Quick improvements (e.g., storage tiers)
4. **Low Savings** - Consider if effort is worth it

### Use Cost Optimization in Planning

- **Before Deployment** - Estimate costs before deploying
- **Architecture Decisions** - Compare cost of different approaches
- **Scaling Decisions** - Understand cost impact of scaling
- **Budget Approval** - Provide cost estimates for approvals

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

- **Estimates Only** - Based on configuration, not actual usage
- **Azure Only** - Currently supports Azure pricing
- **Static Analysis** - Analyzes code, not running infrastructure
- **Pricing Data** - Uses current Azure pricing (may change)

### Coming Soon

- **Actual Usage Integration** - Connect to Azure Cost Management
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - AWS, GCP cost optimization
- **Historical Analysis** - Track costs over time
- **Budget Alerts** - Notifications when approaching budgets

## Troubleshooting

### Cost Estimates Seem High

**Problem:** Estimated costs are higher than expected

**Solutions:**

- Review resource configurations
- Check for duplicate resources
- Verify regional pricing
- Consider actual usage patterns

### No Recommendations

**Problem:** Cost optimization shows no recommendations

**Solutions:**

- Infrastructure may already be optimized
- Check if recommendations are filtered
- Review resource configurations
- Consider manual analysis

### Recommendations Don't Apply

**Problem:** Recommendations don't fit your use case

**Solutions:**

- Review business requirements
- Consider performance needs
- Evaluate risk tolerance
- Customize recommendations (coming soon)

## Next Steps
